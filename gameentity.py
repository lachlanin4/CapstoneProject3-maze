"""
This is the class that encapsulates a component part of the
game that is displayed. It is a base class that all other
displayed game components inherit from. It incorporates
common aspects that apply to any of them. Such common
aspects include name, height and width, x and y position within
the maze. Derived classes might overload, constrain or overload
these aspects as required.
