"""
This is the class that encapsulates the maze which is
being navigated. The maze has a number of sections
including entry, exit, passage ways, corners, left/right 
turns and rooms. Each component of the maze is
connected to another.

The maze has an overall size that could be derived by
the positioning of its component pieces, but that might
be difficult.
